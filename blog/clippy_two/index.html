        Finally, Clippy for Chrome!

        <span class='bold'>Have you ever been browsing the web</span>
        and thought to yourself: "This is too easy and completely not something I need help with... If only I had Clippy while browsing the web to try to help me!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither have I. But <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clippy-2-revenge-of-the-c/ioideobcfemcedhabcggofbnbbmoahfn" target="_blank">here it is anyway.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>* Does clippy do anything useful? No.</li>
          <li>* Is it condescending for no reason? Yes.</li>
          <li>* Is the plugin performant or optimized in any way? Of course not.</li>
          <li>* Will it possibly crash your browser and cause things to break. Almost certainly.</li>

        Lets backtrack
      </p>
      <p>
        The year was almost probably 2012. The month... well it was coldish.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was being worldly and making my way through Berlin, a wonderful city full of coffee and parks.
        As I explored I noticed there happened to be a javascript conference going on, specifically JSConf EU. One thing led to another and I found myself there doing what developers do at conferences, talking about code and drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long story short, Clippy came up (as it is wont to do) and in the state I was in I thought it would be absolutely hilarious to make Clippy for the web. Thus was born Clippy 2.0 Revenge of the Clip.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I half-heartedly set at it. I quickly found <a href="https://www.smore.com/clippy-js"  target="_blank">clippy.js</a>, a project made by the fine people at <a href="http://www.smore.com/" target="_blank">Smore</a>, which I went and hacked up for the extension.
        Here and there over the next few days I typed up this thing while I continued my travels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I forgot about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found it recently and just decided to go ahead and put it out there in its current sad state. But here's where it hopefully gets fun.
      </p>
      <p class='large'>
        I need you!!
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/frausto/clippy_revenge" target="_blank">Go to the github page</a> and check out the code!
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the next few days or however long I feel I'll be looking for your pull requests. Right now Clippy 2 is a mess, clearly it could be better in so many ways (functionality, code, etc..). I'll be merging in your contributions and then when the time is right republish the extension with your contributions included.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets make clippy the best (or worst?) it can be!
