    About a web developer
  </div>
  <div class='content'>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Nolan. I founded Frausto LLC in 2012, in order to make it easier to offer my consulting services to clients. After having worked at <a href="http://thoughtworks.com" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a> as a web developer for a few years, I decided to settle down in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a full stack developer, meaning I develop end to end: backend, frontend, devops, databases, javascript, and whatever else I can get my hands on really. These days I primarily code in Ruby (having done work in C and Java in the past).
    </p>
    <p>
      What it comes down to is that I am just a guy who likes coding. I am a web developer in the New York City area who enjoys climbing, museums, and good beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would be me on the left over there in front of some rocks.
