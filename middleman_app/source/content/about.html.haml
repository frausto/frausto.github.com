      Hello, I'm Nolan. I founded Frausto LLC in 2012, in order to make it easier to offer my consulting services to clients. After having worked at <a href="http://thoughtworks.com" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks</a> as a web developer for a few years, I decided to settle down in New York City and start out on my own.

      I like to work on long-term projects onsite, ideally working in small teams with awesome people. As a full stack developer, I want to develop end to end: backend, devops, databases, javascript, and whatever else I can get my hands on really.

      What it comes down to is that I am just a guy who likes coding. I am a web developer in the New York City area who enjoys climbing, museums, and good beer.

      That would be me on the left over there in front of some rocks.
