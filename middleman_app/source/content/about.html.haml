      Hello, I'm Nolan. I founded Frausto LLC in 2012, in order to make it easier to offer my consulting services to clients. I work both on and off site, and enjoy working in teams. I have experince working as both a front and backend developer, and am happiest working the whole stack end to end, from databases to stylesheets.

      What it comes down to is that I am just a guy who likes coding. I am a web developer in the New York City area who enjoys climbing, museums, and all varieties of food. That would be me on the left over there trying my best to look serious.
