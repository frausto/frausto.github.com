%p
  %span.bold Have you ever been browsing the web
  and thought to yourself: "This is too easy and completely not something I need help with... If only I had Clippy while browsing the web to try to help me!"

%p
  Neither have I. But <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clippy-2-revenge-of-the-c/ioideobcfemcedhabcggofbnbbmoahfn" target="_blank">here it is anyway.</a>

%p
  %ul
    %li * Does clippy do anything useful? No.
    %li * Is it condescending for no reason? Yes.
    %li * Is the plugin performant or optimized in any way? Of course not.
    %li * Will it possibly crash your browser and cause things to break. Almost certainly.

  Finally, Clippy for chrome!

  Lets backtrack

%p
  The year was almost probably 2012. The month... well it was coldish.
%p
  I was being worldly and making my way through Berlin, a wonderful city full of coffee and parks.
  As I explored I noticed there happened to be a javascript conference going on, specifically JSConf EU. One thing led to another and I found myself there doing what developers do at conferences, talking about code and drinking.

%p
  Long story short, Clippy came up (as it is wont to do) and in the state I was in I thought it would be absolutely hilarious to make Clippy for the web. Thus was born Clippy 2.0 Revenge of the Clip.

%p
  So I half-heartedly set at it. I quickly found <a href="https://www.smore.com/clippy-js"  target="_blank">clippy.js</a>, a project made by the fine people at <a href="http://www.smore.com/" target="_blank">Smore</a>, which I went and hacked up for the extension.
  Here and there over the next few days I typed up this thing while I continued my travels.

%p
  Then I forgot about it.

%p
  I found it recently and just decided to go ahead and put it out there in its current sad state. But here's where it hopefully gets fun.

  I need you!!

%p
  <a href="https://github.com/frausto/clippy_revenge" target="_blank">Go to the github page</a> and check out the code!

%p
  Over the next few days, or however long I feel, I'll be actively looking for your pull requests. Right now Clippy 2 is a mess, clearly it could be better in so many ways (functionality, code, etc..).

%p
  I'll be merging in your contributions, and then when the time is right republish the extension with your contributions included. Will it actually be helpful? Will Clippy continue to be an asshole?

%p
  Lets make clippy the best (or worst?) it can be!
