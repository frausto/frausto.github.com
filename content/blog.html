      First Blog Post! So for this first post I figure I'll just quickly go over what I intend this blog to be about before I get started.

      This blog will essentially just be a collection of my thoughts on whatever I happen to be doing at the moment. It will generally focus around technology and business, but really it will be whatever I feel like writing about, because lets face it maybe five people will ever read it (if Im lucky).

      Anyway, thanks for reading. And hello world!
