    <p>
      Hello, I'm Nolan. I founded Frausto LLC in 2012, in order to make it easier to offer my consulting services to clients.

      What it comes down to is that I am just a guy who likes coding. I am a web developer in the New York City area who enjoys climbing, museums, and all varieties of food, and I can easily be talked into a lunch. And yeah, that increadibly professional looking person there on the left would be me.
